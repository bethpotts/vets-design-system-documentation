# Word list

For most terms used on VA.gov, we use the standard American English spelling in Merriam Webster Dictionary. The words on this list are exceptions. 

- We might use different capitalization or hyphenation. 
- We may call for using a more plain language version of a word or to define it in body copy.  
- We may call for using one preferred term on VA.gov when different VA agencies use variations for the same thing.

 For terms that are not on this list, please refer to [Merriam Webster Dictionary](www.merriam-webster.com).

### A

- active duty: Hyphenate when it modifies a noun; do not capitalize (active-duty Servicemember) **[@Working Group, Beth, Danielle: VHA calls for "[service member](https://vaww.va.gov/webcom/style.asp)" in its comms; OPIA also uses "[service member](https://www.va.gov/opa/persona/active_duty.asp)"; not sure what VBA and NCA uses. Let's discuss. I'd like to use lowercase. ]**
- accredited representative: Lowercase, and define on first appropriate instance as "a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. Example:  "Get help from an accredited representative, a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims." 
- advanced: Capitalize only when used as part of the branded term My HealtheVet Advanced. Otherwise lowercase.
- Agent Orange: Define in body copy as "a toxic chemical used to clear trees and plants during the war." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. 
- annual: Use "each year." [@Beth, Danielle - is "annual" really actually difficult for our customers to understand? Annual, annually -- these seem pretty common and easy to understand. (As opposed to terms like bi-annual, bi-weekly, bi-monthly which might be confused between 'twice per' or 'every other.'' ) ]
- apply: Use "file a claim for disability compensation" instead of "apply for benefits."
- Armed Forces: Capitalize. **[@Beth, Danielle, me: VHA style actually calls for citing the different branches in a particular order. Adapt?]**
- asbestos: Define in body copy as "toxic fibers, once used in many buildings and products." It can be defined in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. 
- attending physician: Define it in the context of life insurance as "the doctor in charge of a Veteran's care." It can be defined in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. **[@Beth, Danielle - what about when we are talking directly TO the Veteran, since we should be using 2nd person more often now...?]**

### B

- basic: Capitalize only when used as part of the branded term DS Logon Basic. Otherwise lowercase.
- became ill: Use "got sick."
- became worse: Use "got worse."
- beneficiary: Use this term to mean the person picked to get the money from a life insurance policy when the policyholder dies. In other uses, avoid this term in favor of “family member.”  **[@Beth, Danielle - was this entry meant to convey 'define this as... x'?]**
- Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program: “Benefits” is plural.
- blind or low-vision (not "blind or sight-impaired")

### C

- can vs. may: Use "can" when meaning the ability or power to do something; use "may" when meaning the permission to do it.

- Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD214) **[@Beth, Danielle - not sure what this entry means...? Also, should discuss as part of larger forms topic -- See VA forms/Form names section.]**
- certifying official (as in VA certifying official) **[@Beth, Danielle - not sure what this entry means...?]**
- Character of Discharge review process **[@Beth, Danielle - ditto ^]**
- character of service (more casually referred to as "type of service"): This is a "block" or box on the VA Form DD214 that states one of the following: honorable, general/under honorable conditions, under other than honorable conditions, uncharacterized, or bad conduct.
- chronic: Use "long-lasting" or when needed, "illness that lasts for a long time." 
- claim exam: Use instead of C&P exam. The correct way to refer to it is "VA claim exam." 
- click: Avoid using, especially "click here." Link the relevant words instead. Example: “Find an [accredited representative](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html) to help you.”  **See also Links[@ME:ADDLINKTO LINKS SECTION OF STYLE GUIDE]**
- compensation: Use "payment" or "payments."
- competent: Define as "of legal age and sound mind" in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.
- conditions: On first mention use "illness" or "injury." For all other mentions, "condition" or "conditions" is OK. 
- contamination: Define as "water that was found to have toxic chemicals in it." Can define in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. Exception: On the Camp Lejeune page, don't define this term. 
- continuous: Use "without a break" instead, as in "without a break in service." **[@Beth, Danielle - is this calling for us to NOT ever use the word "continuous"?]**
- convalescence: Use "rehab care" instead.
- court-appointed guardian: Define as "a person the court decides is in charge of caring for another person who can't take care of him or herself." Include definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.

### D

- death benefits: Define as "money from a Veteran’s life insurance policy when that Veteran dies."  Include definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.

- Department of Veterans Affairs (no apostrophe) **[@Beth, Danielle, me - VHA & OPA style calls for something particular for referring to VA - do not use DVA, Dept of VA...etc. Include here.]**
- Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program (also called Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program): Both terms are regularly shortened to DEA. **[@Beth/Danielle - AP Style acronyms or do we currently call for defining on first instance? / jl]**

- deprivation: Define in body copy as "a lack of things such as sleep that people need for their physical and mental well being." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.

- disability or permanent disability: Define in body copy, in another sentence, a parenthetical, or set off with commas, as "a disability that doesn't go away." (Note: this definition goes on the Disability landing page only. Remove or don't define on other pages.) **[ANCHOR LINK TO "permanent disability" entry in P section. ]**
- disability rating: Define as "a rating that measures how bad or severe a disability is." In certain instances, we may use "a rating that measures how bad your disability is and helps us decide your level of benefits."
- disease: Use "illness" unless it is part of a proper name of a specific disease.
- dividend: define as "cash payments made to policyholders when the company makes a profit; OR when life insurance companies make money, they sometimes make cash payments (called dividends) to people who have policies with them." **[@Beth, Danielle - is this what this entry means? Seems like a really long definition.]**
- Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy: Use initial caps and no quotation marks. Don't capitalize "policy."

### E

    - educational and vocational counseling (to be consistent with VR&E Chapter 36: Educational and Vocational Counseling)
  - educational institution
  - educational plan
  - educational program
- equivalent: Use "as in" instead. Example: Other separation documents, as in VA Form DD214 or other separation documents. **[@Beth, Danielle -- should this be "as in" in the example? seems like could be "such as" and that may be more common?]**
- era: Uppercase for Vietnam Era (this is a VA term). If you need to talk about the Vietnam War, which has different dates associated with it than Vietnam Era, style it with "era" lc: Vietnam War era. **[@Beth/Danielle - what is Ic:? Can we use something more plain language? / jl]**
- evidence: Define as "supporting documents" and add, "like a doctor's report or medical test results," as needed. 
- exception: Used to call special attention to something. It should be bolded and never in all caps. **[@Beth/Danielle: could you point out for me example on site? Not sure calling for it to be bolded would always be good...? / jl]**
- excluding: Use "not counting" or "not including."
- expedited: Use "faster." **[@Beth, Danielle - is this guideline specific only to "faster"? Couldn't there be a situation where other plain language phrases might work better or just as well -- more quickly, quicker -- or are we strictly calling for "faster" for consistency?]**
- explosive ordinance: Defined as high-explosive devices, and chemical and nuclear weapons. **[@Beth, Danielle - is entry telling ppl to define phrase like this in body copy? or it's just defining for us internally?]**
- exposure: Use "had contact with” or “come into contact with.”

### F

- family member: Use this term instead of “beneficiary” whenever possible. 
- Family Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI)
- federal: Do not cap "federal" for generic usage such as "federal agency."

- file a claim for disability compensation: Use "file a claim" rather than "apply for benefits."
- final status: Use “in final status” rather than “in a final status."
- financial hardship: Don't use this phrase. Instead say, "Having trouble paying for basic needs, like food and housing." **[@Beth, Danielle - could you provide background on this? This seems like a wordy alternative.]**

### G

- GI: No periods (*not* G.I.).
- GI Bill Comparison Tool: Capitalize "Comparison Tool."
- gravesite: Style this as one word. (Merriam-Webster does not address whether this should be one or two words, but the Gravesite Locator and Arlington National Cemetery both style it as one word. In addition, the following related words do appear in Merriam-Webster as one: graveside and gravestone.)
- guarantee: Can be used as either a noun or a verb. For our purposes, especially within the Home Loans section, when used in a legal context, we use “guarantee” as a verb and “guaranty” as a noun. (“VA guarantees a portion of the loan.”)
- guaranty: Should be used only as a noun. (“Because of VA’s partial guaranty, lenders may offer better loan terms for Veterans.”)
- Guardsman/Guardsmen

### H

- hazardous: use "harmful" or "toxic."
- hazardous exposure: defined as contact with harmful chemicals or other hazardous materials.
- health care: Two words, never hyphenated as a compound adjective, e.g., “health care system.” Do not capitalize unless it is part of the official name of a VA medical center. In addition, defer to the hospital’s official name, which may have health care as one word versus two words. 
- health problems: Use "illnesses and injuries (also known as conditions)." **[@Beth, Danielle - pls cf entry on "physical or mental disorder" which calls for defining it as a "health problem...." Not sure I uderstand rationale of avoiding "health problem" phrase in some instances.]**
- hospitalization: Use "hospital care."
- home loan: Do not use a hyphen when in the form of an adjective. ("home loan benefits").
- Homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.
- How it works: This section is sentence capped and is *not* followed by a colon. **[@Beth, Danielle - not sure meaning? Also, as we move to sentence capitalization in general, we won't need to call out exceptions. Maybe removing okay?]**

### I

- illness: Use "illness" to refer to diseases.
- increased claim: A claim for increased disability compensation if a veteran has a rated service-connected disability that’s gotten worse.  **[@Beth, Danielle - is this entry calling for this term to be defined as such in body copy?]**
- independent living services: No hyphen for the compound adjective.
- Individual Unemployability status: defined as being unable to work. **[@Beth, Danielle - ditto ^ note]**
- individually unemployable: Lowercase.

### K

### L

- lewisite: defined as a natural compound that contains the poisin arsenic. **[@Beth, Danielle - ditto above re defining in body copy?]**
- life insurance: Do not hyphenate in the form of a compound adjective: “life insurance coverage.”
- Loan Guaranty agent: Capped per SME. **[@Working Group & Editorial - Do we need parity for this term; do different agencies capitalize this term differently? @Beth, Danielle - can you provide more info on SME & rationale?]**
- Loan Technician: Capitalize. **[@Working Group, Editorial -- To discuss. I recommend using standard American English -- lowercase unless it is being used as part of someone's title.]
- log in / login: Two words as a verb. For all other parts of speach, it should be one word. **[@Beth, Danielle, Workng Group, Editorial - how do/should we use sign in/sign on/signon/ log in/ logon/ login? I have seen numerous variations and anticipate increasing inconsistencies if we don't codify this.]**
- Loss of range of motion: Use "problems moving your body."

### M

- manufacturing: Use "making."
- maximum: Use "top limit." **[@Beth, Danielle - background on this? "Maximum" seems fairly common and easy to understand. If we really call for "top limit" instead of "maximum," would like to have a good reason for the Working Group.]**
- may: See entry for "can."
- Military Occupation Code (MOC)
- Million Veteran Program (MVP)
- Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty
- Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve
- My Health*e*Vet: Italicize the "e." **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group - I actually see that in body text, we do NOT italicize the 'e.' It appears italics only in the logo. For example on the [MHV site](www.myhealthevet.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/about-mhv) itself, body copy does NOT italicize the e. Another [MHV example](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/user-registration) - scroll down for body copy. Let's clarify/modify, as italics is pretty against common web best practice, especially for text links and so on.]**

### N

- National Guard
- new claim: A claim for added benefits or other benefit requests related to an existing service-connected disability. **[@Beth, Danielle - I think I added this from one of the VA.gov pages you worked on which listed definitions for a bunch of different kinds of claims. Should we include them in the Word list? maybe it's not relevant if we are not calling for these terms to be defined as such in body copy. Other terms from that page -- original claim, secondary claim, reopened claim...]**
- non-traditional: Hyphenate when preceding and modifying a noun.
- nonpay: Do not hyphenate.
- Note: Used to call special attention to something. It is bolded and never in all caps.

- original claim: The first claim a veteran files for disability compensation. **[@Beth, Danielle - see note on 'new claim']**

### P

- PO Box: Do not use periods.

- patient: Use "person living with," as in "person living with diabetes" instead of "diabetes patient."

- percent: Use the symbol % rather than spelling it out, for scannability.

- period of honorable service (not honorable period of service)

- permanent disability: a disability that's not expected to improve. **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group - compare with entries for disability...]**  

- > disability or permanent disability: Define in body copy, in another sentence, a parenthetical, or set off with commas, as "a disability that doesn't go away." (Note: this definition goes on the Disability landing page only. Remove or don't define on other pages.)

- Persian Gulf War era: Lowercase "era."

- physical or mental disorder: defined as a health problem that affects the body or mind. **[@Beth, Danielle - is this entry saying to define this phrase as "health problem that affects..."? Also, cf entry on "health problem," which says to use "illnesses and injuries (also known as conditions)" - so this would really be... illness (also known as a condition) that affects the body or mind"?? ]**

- post-9/11: We use the slash rather than the hyphen for 9/11 (*not* 9-11). For example, Post-9/11 GI Bill.

- presumptive disability: Use "health problem" and reference when needed for clarity. Example: " a health problem (called presumptive disability) that we've concluded is likely caused by... "

- Prisoner of War: Capitalized to match the 10-10EZ. **[@Working Group, Editorial - The [DOD military dictionary does NOT capitalize this term](https://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=4243). Therefore, I recommend using the same standard American English lowercase, _except_ when it is part of a proper noun such as the name of a form or law, like the "Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War."]**

- Project 112/SHAD

- process (a claim): Use "review."

- prove...is related to: Use "show...is likely caused by" **[@Beth, Danielle - can you clarify this entry, I am not sure what it's supposed to mean]**

- PTSD: posttraumatic stress disorder (no hyphen) **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group -- would like to know how other agencies, particularly medical centers, use this term. MW uses the hyphen "post-traumatic stress disorder," which seems more common to me, and is actually easier to scan. Also, what is our current usage -- do we always spell it out in body copy, first instance only, do we use acronym, then spelling, or vice versa; or is this acronym considered common enough that we omit spelled term?]**

### Q

### R

- regional benefit office
- reopened claim: A claim to provide new evidence to support a disability claim that was denied in the past. **[@Beth, Danielle - see note above on "new claim"]**
- Reserves
- Reservist
- respiratory disease: Use "breathing problems" or "lung disease."
- resume: Don't use accent marks when referring to the noun, as in a job resume.
- retroactively: Define in body copy as "takes effect starting from a date in the past." **[@Beth, Danielle - was this word something that was confusing to customers? Would like to better understand the reasoning, as I find the separate definition actually more confusing.]**

### S

- secondary claim: A claim to get more disability benefits for a new disability that’s linked to an existing service-connected disability. For example: arthritis that’s caused by an existing service-connected knee injury. **[@Beth, Danielle - note related to new claim, original claim, secondary claim, etc.]**

- Selected Reserve  **[@Beth, Danielle - what does this entry mean?]** Beth's note: capitalize this term.

- service connected: Hyphenate when preceding a noun. For example, "a Veteran with a service-connected disability." Otherwise, do not hyphenate. For example, "The disability is considered service connected."

- service-connected condition: Define in body copy as an "illness or injury caused—or made worse by— active-duty service." Can define in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.  For example: "A service-connected condition is an illness or injury caused—or made worse by—your active-duty service."

- service-connected disability: In most cases, add the definition separately as another sentence or a note below a bulleted list. For example: "Having a service-connected disability means we've concluded that you're disabled because of an illness or injury caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service."  

- service-connection: Hyphenate this term. For example: "You may be eligible for service-connection."

- Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance (S-DVI): Life insurance for Veterans who have become disabled as a result of serving in the military. **[@Beth, Danielle - is this entry telling ppl to define in body copy?]**

- service member: Lowercase **[@Working Group & editorial: VHA calls for "[service member](https://vaww.va.gov/webcom/style.asp)" in its comms; OPIA also uses "[service member](https://www.va.gov/opa/persona/active_duty.asp)"; not sure what VBA and NCA uses. Let's discuss. Prefer lowercase, two words - this is more aligned with our modernization and plain language vision. MW does not have "servicemember" or "service member" as an entry; it has "servicemen" and "servicewomen," but "service" and "member" separately. [DoD military dictionary](www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-dictionary.asp) also does NOT have an entry for "servicemember"; it refers to "service enlistees," (lowercase, two words) or "members of" [X specific branch] or "[X] member."  ] **

- > Servicemember: One word and cap the S. 

- > Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) **[@Working group & editorial: these can be exceptions due to their being part of branded product/program names, but otherwise use standard "service member." See also notes below re what we are advising by entry - how do we want copy to refer to thing.]**

- > Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Disability Extension (SGLI-DE) **[@Beth, Danielle - see below note]**

- > Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI) **[@Beth, Danielle - not sure what this entry is advising. Are we saying spell it out and then use the acronym in parens? See entry under TSGLI - which provides spelled out, but doesn't say how it should be referred to in copy.]**

- Social Security number: Use this capitalization per Merriam-Webster (do not cap "number").

- special claim: A disability claim to request compensation for special needs such as temporary payments when recovering from surgery and unable to move or work. **[@Beth, Danielle - see note on original claim, new claim, secondary claim, etc.]**

- Stand Down: Capitalize when referring to the homeless event. **[@Beth, Danielle - not sure what homeless event refers to -- ??]**

- Suicide: Are you thinking of hurting yourself or others? (not "Are you having thoughts of suicide?)

- substantially gainful employment **[@Beth, Danielle - what's this entry mean?]**

- survivors: Use "qualified survivors."

- Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance program (also called Dependents’ Educational Assistance program). Both terms can be shortened to DEA after first instance. **[@Beth, Danielle - I added "after first instance" because it seems like it could get confused with THAT other DEA otherwise?? at least in search and stuff?]**

### T

- terminal illness: A sickness that can't be cured and that will likely result in the person’s death within a short period of time. **[@Beth, Danielle - is this calling for defining in body copy? Could you provide actual example on VA.gov?]**
- Track Your Claim (use this phrasing for the blue button). We should reach for consistency across the site--top nav "Manage" dropdown, blue button, text links, etc. **[@Beth, Danielle - not sure what entry means]**
- trauma: an injury or deeply disturbing experience. **[@Beth, Danielle - ditto ^ - are you calling for term to be defined in body copy or to not use the word "trauma" and instead use "an injury or deeply disturbing..."?]**
- TSGLI: Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group - I'm confused - where is the T in TSGLI?]**

### U

- U.S.: This takes periods.

### V

- VA: Don't insert "the" before VA when it is used as a noun. However, when VA serves as an adjective, do use the article. For example: "The VA task force announced today...." In full, the Department of Veterans Affairs.

- > The following is taken from the [VHA Style and Usage](https://vaww.va.gov/webcom/style.asp) page. **@Working group, Editorial - let's discuss** whether this belongs in the word list or whether it warrants its own section in the style guide. This info seems rather bulky for a word list entry; but we can also consider streamlining this for VA.gov, since it's not clear that all of this is relevant for the website - **for instance, on VA.gov, we DON'T put VA inside parentheses, since the global header prominently shows the official logo with VA | and the full spelled out U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.** Since this header appears on every page on VA.gov, it would be redundant to put "(VA)" in body copy, even on first reference.  
  >
  > References to Department of Veterans Affairs
  >  The full title is the “Department of Veterans Affairs” (no apostrophe).
  >  It should be used whenever a first reference to the department is made.
  >  The abbreviation “VA” (not DVA) should be put in parentheses.
  >  Subsequent references can be either to “the department” or “VA.”
  >  Sometimes, VA may need to be distinguished from a state’s Department of Veterans Affairs.
  > In that case, the full title can be “U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.”
  >  Do not use “the” before the abbreviation when it is used as a noun. For example: “VA
  > announced today that....” If VA is used as an adjective, then “the” will be used in front of
  > “VA.” For example: “The VA task force announced today that ....”

- VA.gov: Treat it as a brand name; omit www. and always capitalize the VA and lowercase .gov. 

- > Do: Preview the new VA.gov.
  >
  > Don't: Va.gov has all the information you need to apply for your Veterans benefits.

- VA health care facility

- VA medical center: "Medical Center" should only be capitalized if a specific medical center name is included in the title. Don't shorten to "VA center."

- VA regional office: "Regional Office" should only be capitalized if a specific name is included in the title.

- vesicant agents: Use "vesicant (blistering) agents."

- Vet Center: Capitalize the C. **[@Beth, Danielle - is this really an official branded name? "Vet Center"?]**

- Veteran: Capitalize even when used as a common noun on VA.gov. When possible, you can avoid this awkward style by recasting sentences into a more conversational tone and speaking directly with the Veteran, rather than referring to them in the third person. 

- > Okay: Learn about the services and benefits that the VA offers to Veterans and their families. 
  >
  > Better: Learn about VA services and benefits that you and your family may be eligible for. 

- Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) 

- Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)

- Veterans cemetery: "Veterans" does not take an apostrophe, and "cemetery" is lowercase except when part of the full name of a cemetery. 

- > Example: Family members may be eligible if they're buried in a Veterans cemetery. 
  >
  > Exception: The Hawaii State Veterans Cemetery is located in Kaneohe, HI.

- Veterans Crisis Line: "Veterans" does not take an apostrophe. The phone number is 1-800-273-8255. **[@Beth, Danielle - the ph# was in parens, but did you intend to convey that the # should always appear in parens after the text? or did you just want the correct ph# to be available and listed here in the entry? What happens if the ph# changes without our team's knowledge? Maybe we should include a list of the most essential VA phone numbers that we reference on our site?]**

- Veterans Employment Center™ (VEC) **[@Beth, Daniell, Working Group: do we have guidelines on the use of trademarks? e.g., use the symbol on first use only or on every instance or in headlines only or never in headlines/only in body copy...?]**

- Veterans Health Administration (VHA)

- Veterans Job Bank: "Veterans" is plural.

- Veterans Service Organization (VSO): "Veterans" is plural.

- Veterans Service Representative (VSR): “Veterans” is plural.

- Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP): Takes a plural possessive apostrophe—Veterans'.

- Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI): Takes a plural possessive apostrophe—Veterans'.

- Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI): Takes a plural possessive apostrophe—Veterans'.

- Vets.gov: Always capitalize the "V" — it's a brand name **[@Beth, Danielle - remove from list, since it's deprecated now?]**

- Vietnam Era: Uppercase "era," but "Vietnam War era" (lowercase "era"). Mostly we use the first term: Vietnam Era.

### W

- website: One word, not capitalized.
- work study: Two words, not hyphenated as a noun; hyphenate when usedas an adjective preceding a noun. **[@Beth, Danielle - can you provide example on VA.gov? And would we really use for example, hyphenated, "work-study program"? This seems really really arcane, versus simply using the phrase as a compound adjective -- work study program.]**

### X

### Y

- Yellow Ribbon Scholarship (Yellow Ribbon Program): Capitalize “Program.”

### Z

- zip code: Lowercase, two words.
